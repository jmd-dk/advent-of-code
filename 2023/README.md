## Advent of code 2023
My solutions to the [2023 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/),
written in Python 3.12.

### Guidelines adopted
* Python standard library only (no additional packages).
* Parts 1 and 2 are to be solved separately.

### Magic
In [`magic.py`](magic.py) we define helper functionality used by
the solutions.
